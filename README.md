# Boid-Simulator
I was very interested in ALife, the modeling of life using simulation, and I decided to start with a simple but cool project of modeling flocking. While the model isn't perfect, I took inspiration from Craig Reynolds, and his framework for creating flocking.

Improvements:
- Incorporate Predators
- Add Vision
- Make it look nicer
- Optimize it by storing the cells in which agents lie
- Add Obstacles
- Incorporate Fluid Dynamics (why birds go in Vs)
- etc.
